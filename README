This is a simple test project to test creating group chat using socket.io

It includes the server code for running the node.js server as well as the client side chat app.

The /www folder is pure html stuff and is intended to be served using any web server. I was using apache.

However the node code will start its own server on port 8080 which the client side code in /www will connect to (and fetch socket.io client side js library)
